# Academia System
This was part of a project from the Course CS513 ESD of IIIT Bangalore where as part of an Academic Managment System I had to
Compute Student Specialisation Allow the employee of admin department to login. Then view the specialisations of all students 
or filtered by various criteria such as domain, specialisation, etc. The student has a specialisation in a particular domain 
if they have selected courses such that the cumulative sum in a certain specialisation of those courses is greater than 20 credits.

# 1) Login Page
The Admin has to login using a valid credential, proper exception handling is done to check for Authentication and Authorization.

# 2) Student List Page
Once the Admin is validated he/she can see the list of all the students and even can sort via different conditions provided in the dropdown.
