# Academia System
This was part of a project from the Course CS513 ESD of IIIT Bangalore where we had to build an Academics Managment System

# 1) Login Page
The Admin has to login using a valid credential, proper exception handling is done to check for Authentication and Authorization.

# 2) Student List Page
Once the Admin is validated he/she can see the list of all the students and even can sort via different conditions provided in the dropdown.
